    <h1>Hannah's School Talent show</h1>
 <p>
A few weeks ago, I had a school talent show and I chose to play Turkish March by W.A. Mozart. Mozart was born in Vienna, Germany. At the age of four, he started taking keyboard lessons, and by the age of five he was already composing short pieces. When Mozart and his sister Nannerl were traveling to preform in concerts, Mozart also learned to play the violin and organ.When Mozart was 8 years old, he published two Sonatas for the harpsichord. Some of Mozart's most famous pieces was Eine Kleine Nachtmusik for string orchestra, which means 'A Little Night Music', and Ah vous dirais-je, Maman for piano solo, which has a total of 12 variations on a french tune. On December 5, 1791, Mozart died at the age of 35 from a high fever, and left behind a collection of 600 compositions.


After the show, our dad surprised us by taking us out for dinner to The Cheesecake Factory! We all had a great dinner and a delicious ice cream sundae for desert.

<h1>Sarah's Violin Performance</h1>
<p>
I recently celebrated my 12th birthday, and at my party, I played two pieces on the violin. My first piece was called Theme from Schindler's List by John Williams, an American musician, composer, and conductor. John Williams received his 29th Academy Award nomination for Schindler's List, and he composed many other famous pieces for movies such as Fiddler on the Roof, Star Wars, and E.T. In addition to being a famous violin piece, Schindler's list is also a movie about Oskar Schindler, a famous businessman. In the beginning of World War II, Oscar owned a factory in Poland in which he used the Jewish workers. After seeing what the Nazis did to the Jews, he decides to try and save as many Jews as he can by creating a list of essential workers.  The people put on his list got saved. Today, Oskar Schindler is remembered as a hero who saved over 1100 Jewish lives, and this movie and piece is based on his life story. Schindler's list is a very melancholy piece, and although it captures a heart-breaking event in our history, I really enjoyed learning and playing it.

In addition to playing Schindler's List, my sister, Hannah and I prepared a duet called Canon in D Major by John Pachelbell. This piece is often played at wedding's, or for a special occasions, Although it is a very famous piece, not much is known about it. Historians don't even know the exact date it was composed. They believe it was composed around 1680, and people believe it was written for Bach's brother, Johann Christoph's wedding on October 23, 1694. Pachelbell wrote over 500 classical music pieces during his lifetime, and he composed during the Baroque period. He was an organist, and even taught the man who became Bach's teacher. This piece has a lot of emotion to it, and many challenging parts.  When playing a duet,  both players have to listen to each other. I played two boxes ahead of Hannah, and it was difficult to always stay two boxes ahead, and not play too fast or too sow. In the end, Hannah and I succeeded in working well together, and I hope you enjoy listening to it as much as we do.</p>
    <h>Sarah's Violin and Piano Recital</h>
    <p>
In September  I had a violin recital held in a local church. I played Preludium and Allegro by a famous composer named Kreisler. He was born on February 2, 1875 in Austria and he died January 29, 1962. He was one of the most famous violin masters of his time, and is regarded as one of the greatest violinist. He is known for his sweet tone and expressive phrasing. Preludium and Allegro was published in 1905, and it is a piece in two sections. The first section consists mostly of quarter notes and is melodic and slow. However, the second part is quick paced, and uplifting. I practiced many hours for this performance, as the fast part was very hard and required a lot of practice. I hope you enjoy listening.
<br/>
        After I played on the violin, it was again my turn to play on the piano. I played October ("Autumn Song") by Tchaikovsky and A complaint by Grechaninov. Tchaikovsky is a Russian composer of the late Romantic Period, and he was born May 7, 1840  and died November 6, 1893. His works are among the most popular in the classical music. October is a beautiful and very melodic piece that I really enjoyed learning and performing.  Grechaninov was a Russian composer who also composed during the romantic period. He was born on October 25, 1864 and died on January 3, 1956. He wrote many pieces for the piano, and a complaint was a very dramatic piece filled with many dynamics. These dynamics made the piece interesting to listen to. I hope you enjoy!
